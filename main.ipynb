      "MXenes, a new class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides, have gained significant research attention due to their exceptional physicochemical properties, making them attractive as active materials for sensing applications. These sensors have diverse uses, including gas sensors for pollutants, biosensors for diagnostics, strain sensors for wearables, and optical sensors for light or chemical changes. They leverage on MXene's unique conductivity, surface and redox reactivity, optoelectronic properties, and thermal behaviour, highlighting their versatility across various technologies. Despite progress, key challenges such as material limitations, processing difficulties, limited real-world testing, and lack of scalable manufacturing, still hinder commercial adoption. This review summarizes the recent progress in MXene-based sensors, examines these challenges, and aims toward the development of cost-effective, high-performance sensors for soft electronics. It also provides guidance for the future development of more efficient sensors and aims to inspire innovations in the field.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "MXenes, a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides and/or nitrides, have gained considerable attention across various fields due to their highly processable layered structure and remarkable physicochemical properties1,2,3. Since 2011, over 50 MXene compositions have been reported, with many unique carbide/carbonitride combinations theoretically predicted (Mn+1XnTx, where n = 1-4, M = transition metal, X = carbon and/or nitrogen, and T = surface functional groups such as -O-, =O, -OH, -F, -Cl)4,5. One widely studied example is Ti3C2Tx MXene, which stands out among 2D nanomaterials for its exceptional electrical conductivity (>20,000 cm−1)6,7,8, electrochemical behavior (e.g. capacitance > 2800 F cm−3)9,10,11, surface reactivity, opto-electronic properties, and thermal stability. This combination of properties makes MXenes highly suitable for diverse sensing applications, including gas sensors for detecting pollutants12 and toxic gases13, biosensors for medical diagnostics14 and health monitoring15, strain sensors for wearable electronics16, and optical sensors for detecting light or chemical changes17. Recent studies have focused on enhancing the selectivity and sensitivity of MXenes through surface functionalization18, structural modifications19 (e.g., doping), and composite formation20,21.\n",
      "Incorporating MXene into a host material does not diminish its exceptional properties, unlike most other 2D nanomaterials22,23, enabling molecular imprinting of polymers24 or decoration of ligands25 on the sheet surface without losing conductivity. These surface modifications can create additional active sites for analyte interaction, thereby improving detection capability, selectivity, and overall sensing performance. Likewise, incorporating MXene into polymer matrices improves their electrical conductivity, even with low MXene loading, resulting in durable, lightweight, and highly sensitive physical sensors ideal for wearable electronics26,27,28, healthcare monitoring29, and soft robotics applications30,31.\n",
      "Advancements in improving the performance of MXene-based sensors have laid the groundwork for their potential commercialization21,32,33. However, achieving industrial-scale production necessitates overcoming key challenges, such as MXenes' susceptibility to oxidative degradation. Achieving multifunctionality requires balancing properties without compromising performance. Scalability remains a challenge due to the complex synthesis and fabrication processes, which must be understood and optimized for large-scale manufacturing while maintaining material properties. This review offers insights into these relevant obstacles to identify methods that enhance sensor performance while uncovering the fundamental and practical limitations of existing MXene-based sensing materials. It also critically analyzes how these factors impact the fabrication of target sensing platforms, aiming to resolve performance issues related to material defects and architectural mismatch. Addressing these impediments is expected to accelerate the development of next-generation MXene-based sensors.\n",
      "Specific challenges in developing MXene-based sensors\n",
      "What makes MXenes good materials for sensors?\n",
      "MXenes are highly versatile materials for diverse sensor applications. Their outstanding properties, including high electrical conductivity34, chemically active surfaces35, and single-sheet mechanical flexibility36, meet the critical requirements for effectively responding to various stimuli37. For example, their combination of mechanical flexibility and electrical conductivity makes them ideal for pressure and strain sensors used in wearable devices, robotics, and structural health monitoring. MXene-based fibers have been investigated for their responsiveness to external stimuli, such as humidity changes38,39, due to their surface chemistry and hydrophilicity.\n",
      "Their tunable 2D structure facilitates rapid ion transport, enabling swift response times and enhanced sensitivity for superior sensing capabilities40. This makes them highly preferable in gas sensors for detecting various gases such as NH341,42, CH443,44 and CO245. MXenes can also be used in electrochemical sensors for detecting a wide variety of chemical species, ranging from pollutants (e.g. pesticides)46 and heavy metals (e.g. cadmium and lead)47 to biomarkers (e.g. human anti-ASGPR)48.\n",
      "As mentioned above, the versatility of MXenes' chemistry and the variety of structures allow for the development of different sensor types. For simplicity, we categorized these sensors into three groups :\n",
      "-\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Physical sensors, which rely on structural deformations to change resistivity or capacitance.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Chemical/electrochemical sensors, which detect changes in resistance and electrochemical behavior from interactions with the MXene surface.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "Optical/spectroscopic sensors, which use MXene's optical properties to detect stimuli such as light, chemicals, and biomolecules.\n",
      "Based on the current literature, we have identified some key challenges associated with the fundamental mechanism and device fabrication processes. These challenges include understanding the underlying principles that govern sensor performance and optimizing fabrication techniques to ensure consistency and scalability.\n",
      "Common challenges faced by MXene-based sensors and how we can solve them\n",
      "Physical sensors\n",
      "Physical sensors detect physical changes in the environment, such as strain, pressure, temperature, or light, and convert them into electrical signals49, for applications that include healthcare50, robotics51, and wearables52. MXenes are effective for physical sensors due to their exceptional electrical conductivity53, charge storage capability54, and piezoresistive properties49. To improve responsiveness to physical changes, MXenes are typically used to modify composites, amplifying signals through their inherent conductivity, enhancing device sensitivity, response time, and stress/strain detection33. Notably, Ti3C2Tx remains the most conductive MXene reported and is currently the preferred choice for this type of sensor. For this section, we discussed common types of MXene-based physical sensors, such as strain, pressure, acoustic, and temperature sensors, with a comprehensive summary of representative examples in .\n",
      "Strain sensors\n",
      "A strain sensor operates on the change in electrical resistance when a material is subjected to stretching55,56. Effective strain sensors must provide a wide working linear range with consistent responses and demonstrate stability over at least 500 loading/unloading cycles to endure dynamic use. The layered structure of MXenes is advantageous in accommodating mechanical deformations while maintaining functionality, with a high gauge factor (GF), the figure of merit for sensitivity, which ensures precise strain detection. The MXene-based sensing behavior mainly relies on the disruption of the interconnected Ti3C2Tx flakes when strain is applied, altering the material's overall electrical resistance (-i)57,58. The high conductivity of Ti3C2Tx maintained over a wide sensing range allows for higher sensitivity, making MXene-based sensors effective for precise sensing applications, such as heartbeat monitoring57. The versatility of sensor design is also possible due to MXene's compatibility with many polymers, which eases its processing into films, aerogels, or fibers3. MXenes can be incorporated into fibrous structures (e.g., coated yarns), enhancing stretchability and allowing integration into textiles. These sensors have higher strain detection limits and mechanical resilience, making them ideal for wearable devices, robotics, and flexible electronics. For example, Yang et al. developed Ti3C2Tx MXene@TPU sensors by spin-coating MXene dispersions onto electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) mats, achieving high sensitivity (GF = 228 and LOD = 0.1%), with a working range up to 150% strain59. However, for most of these studies, the washability of Ti3C2Tx, stemming from ineffective coating techniques, remains a limitation, warranting further investigation. The selected fabrication technique, such as spin coating, printing, or layer-by-layer assembly, directly affects film uniformity, adhesion, and strain transfer efficiency between the MXene layer and the substrate. Inconsistent control of these factors can lead to significant variations in sensor output, increased hysteresis, accelerated fatigue, and ultimately, reduced performance and reproducibility across batches.\n",
      "To address coating issues and improve material utility, methods focusing on substrate compatibility and optimized Ti3C2Tx integration have been explored. The work of Uzun et al.60 demonstrated that highly conductive MXene-coated cotton yarns can be knitted with equipment used in the textile industry (-ii). After 45 cycles of washing, the MXene-coated cotton yarns showed only a minimal increase in resistance (-iii), attributed to the strong H-bonding of the cellulose-rich fibers with MXene. Sensor performance can be further improved by chemically modifying the interaction between MXene and substrates, which is advantageous for non-fibrous architectures61, which typically have fewer anchor points for MXenes. For instance, an interface binder such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN) can enhance the interaction of MXene with a TPU substrate during electrospinning. The resulting MXene/TPU/PAN strain sensor achieved a wide sensing range of 0-80%, GF of 9.69, LOD of <0.1%, and durability after >1750 cycles62. Flexible substrates such as TPU or polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) can also be layered with MXenes to extend the strain detection range while maintaining high conductivity, enabling sensors to withstand larger deformations. Seyedin et al. demonstrated the continuous fabrication of wet-spun MXene/PU coaxial fibers, which are both highly conductive and stretchable. These fibers, featuring an MXene/PU core surrounded by a flexible PU sheath, exhibited a low percolation threshold of ~1 wt% MXene and outstanding strain sensing capabilities, with a GF of ~12,900 at 152% strain. This coaxial design also enhanced the fibers' stability under cyclic deformation57.\n",
      "It is important to note that the amount of MXene incorporated critically affects the percolation network and gauge factor. Insufficient MXene loading can result in poor conductivity and low signal-to-noise ratios, while excessive loading may reduce sensitivity due to limited strain-induced resistance changes.\n",
      "Other 2D materials, such as graphene, can also be integrated to enhance the strain sensing performance of MXene sensors 63,64. In the study by Taromsari et al., a graphene nanoplatelet (GnP)-MXene hybrid was used to form a strain sensor with enhanced strain sensitivity (GF ~ 400 at 100% strain) and cyclic stability after over 2000 cycles.\n",
      "Pressure sensors\n",
      "A pressure sensor generally consists of a force-sensitive layer, conductive electrodes, and a flexible substrate that works by converting the physical force exerted by pressure into an electrical signal52. MXene-based pressure sensors use piezoresistive, piezoelectric, capacitive, triboelectric, and potentiometric properties, causing electrical resistance variations under pressure (-i)65.\n",
      "In piezoresistive sensors, MXene is used as a force-sensing layer, with its conductivity changing in response to external pressure. An example is the piezoresistive sensor built by Ma and co-workers using an ultralight and superelastic MXene/reduced graphene oxide (MX/rGO) hybrid 3D aerogel with exceptionally high sensitivity (22.56 kPa-1), rapid response time (<200 ms), and excellent stability over 10,000 cycles66. Meanwhile, a capacitive pressure sensor (CPS) detects the change in capacitance from the altered separation distance between two parallel electrodes67. The development of CPS devices faces difficulties in achieving both optimum mechanical properties and high sensitivity. An example of a study addressing this challenge is the work by Sharma et al., which demonstrated the fabrication of a wearable CPS utilizing a MXene (Ti3C2Tx)/poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF-TrFE) composite scaffold as the dielectric layer to enhance LOD (1.5 Pa), pressure range (up to 400 kPa), and mechanical stability for over 10,000 cycles under high pressure (~167 kPa)68. Similar challenges are also common for piezoelectric sensors. In the study by Wang et al., MXene's non-centrosymmetric lattice was utilized to enable charge polarization under external force, generating a piezoelectric effect, which was further enhanced by the piezoelectric properties of PVDF-TrFE. PVDF-TrFE/MXene composite nanofibers developed using electrospinning exhibited improved piezoelectric performance, with a peak-to-peak output voltage of 1.58 V (three times higher than pure PVDF-TrFE), a linear pressure response, and an energy harvesting capability of ~3.64 mW/m2 (-ii)69. For triboelectric sensors, difficulties in satisfying high dielectric constant, large electron affinity, and surface area to improve charge density were mitigated by using MXene as an electrode material. This was demonstrated in the development of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) using MXene, carboxylic acid-functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes, and a fluorinated polymer matrix, performing at an outstanding output voltage of ~300 V, current of ~40 μA under 20 N force, and 92% charge retention after 1 h. Its superior durability and mechanical stability enabled it to power wearable electronics and support a wearable pH monitoring system70,71. Lastly, potentiometric sensors utilize MXene's flexibility and functional groups for redox reactions, providing self-powered, stable electrical signals without the need for external energy sources, ideal for miniaturized electronic skin71.\n",
      "Another critical factor in integrating MXene into pressure sensors is selecting an optimal microstructure for the force-sensitive layer to enhance performance. To improve the pressure detection range and sensitivity, MXene is incorporated into porous structures (e.g., aerogels and foams) to increase the surface area for conductive pathways. Recent developments include the fabrication of a compressible, lamellar aerogel by combining MXene nanosheets with cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to prevent restacking during fabrication. The stable lamellar structure ensures elasticity and stable signal response under pressure, making it ideal for wearable piezoresistive devices and biosignal detection72. MXene-based fibers and fabrics can also improve the interaction between the force-sensitive and electrode layers, enhancing response speed and sensitivity. As example, a wearable, washable pressure-sensing fabric was created by utilizing the natural roughness of cotton fibers and MXene's functional groups to achieve strong interfacial interactions. The MXene-coated fabric showed high pressure sensitivity (gauge factor of 7.67 kPa−1), fast response (<35 ms), and long-term durability (>2000 cycles), and was demonstrated as a flexible human-machine interface with multitouch capabilities and rapid response times73. These techniques enable MXene sensors to achieve high sensitivity, fast response, and long-lasting durability due to the capability to produce structures with optimized electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility.\n",
      "However, MXene's pressure-sensing capabilities also lag those of other composites. For instance, rGO/PET-based fiber sensors were found to outperform their MXene/PET counterparts due to the limitations of MXenes discussed in the previous sections74. Modifications to its structure or integration with supporting materials could enhance performance and expand its applications.\n",
      "Acoustic sensors\n",
      "Acoustic sensors detect sound or vibrations and convert them into electrical signals. Selecting materials with high conductivity and piezoelectric characteristics is key to efficient signal conversion. Flexibility and compatibility with various surfaces that maximize sound adsorption further enhance their application potential. Moreover, suitability for compact designs is essential for seamless integration into portable or wearable devices75.\n",
      "Prominent MXene-based acoustic sensors include a highly sensitive artificial eardrum using double-layer films of MXene, PDMS, and poly(ethylene) (PE) (-i)76. MXene nanoflakes were evenly distributed within a pyramid-shaped PDMS structure, leveraging two enhancements: the large interlayer spacing in the MXene layer and the PDMS micro-pyramid design (-ii). This sensor demonstrated high sensitivity (62 kPa−1), low-pressure detection (0.1 Pa), and a working frequency range of 0.15-3 kHz, showcasing its potential for wearable human-machine interaction devices. These advancements in MXene acoustic sensors show promise for speech recognition applications.\n",
      "However, refinement is needed to enhance their frequency response and detection limits for more effective human voice sensing75. MXenes have low sensitivity at low pressures and a limited frequency range due to their inherent stiffness and excessive electrical conductivity, which hinder their ability to detect small pressure changes and high-frequency sound waves effectively77. Hybrid assemblies of MXenes and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) address key limitations of MXenes as acoustic sensors. The piezoresistive properties and chemical stability of TMDs improve the sensor's robustness, durability, and frequency range. This synergy enhances sensitivity, enabling more accurate detection of sound across a wider range of frequencies, making the hybrid structures ideal for applications like voice recognition and environmental monitoring. In a study by Chen et al., they developed a machine-learning-based speech recognition system using flexible MXene/MoS2-coated plastic substrates78. The combination of flexible substrate and nanomaterial hybrid enhances mechanical strength, enabling the composite to vibrate with sound, alter resistance, and distinguish sound frequencies and volumes.\n",
      "Temperature sensors\n",
      "Temperature sensors detect changes by converting thermal energy into electrical signals. MXenes, especially Ti3C2Tx, are favored for this type of sensor due to their excellent electro-thermal and photo-thermal conversion capabilities in sensor design79. However, due to MXene's high electrical conductivity, the resistivity does not change significantly with temperature, requiring additional treatments for enhancing temperature sensitivity. To address this, Tran et al. formulated a composite of MXenes and poly(2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA)80. As the temperature decreases, PDMAEMA aligns perpendicularly to the substrate, increasing the spacing between MXene flakes and reducing conductivity. This resulted in an MXene composite with a conductivity that responds more significantly than pure MXene to temperature shifts between 25 and 40 °C21,81. Cao et al. also fabricated a temperature sensor using an MXene and PDMS substrate hybrid. When heated, the PDMS substrate swells, causing the MXene flakes to disrupt the percolation network, leading to a significant increase in the MXene resistance82.\n",
      "Significant progress in this area has focused on solving mechanical instability during repeated temperature-response cycles, as swelling or realignment of polymers and additives can damage the sensing architecture. These issues were mitigated by using temperature-stable polymers and robust structures for support. Zhao et al. developed a tissue-like sodium alginate hydrogel-based temperature sensor that operates across a wide temperature range (−20 to 100 °C), with the MXene providing conductivity and thermal responsiveness, while the SA-coating layer enhances heat sensitivity 83. In a recent study, Fu et al. designed MXene fiber artificial muscles (MFAMs) with tensile actuation capabilities upon heating. As the temperature increases from 25 to 125 °C, the intra-sheet spacing of MXene decreases, resulting in a reversible muscle contraction of up to 21.0%84. These advancements highlight MXenes' potential for high-performance temperature sensors, leveraging their thermoelectric properties, flexibility, and conductivity.\n",
      "Photo-sensitive sensors\n",
      "MXene-based photosensors use the properties of MXene to interact with light, triggering structural changes. An early example is Chertopalov's work using partially oxidized MXene as a photo-responsive material. Here, the spontaneous oxidation of MXene thin films produces Ti3C2Tx-TiO2 composites with resistance that can vary upon UV irradiation85. Although MXenes generate heat from absorbed light, the architecture lacks significant resistance changes with temperature, requiring additional treatments for enhanced sensitivity. In the study of Xiao et al., they presented a flexible actuator composed of paraffin wax (PW) and a Ti3C2Tx-rich layer. As MXene photothermally facilitates the evaporation of adsorbed moisture within the layers, the asymmetric distribution of the hydrophobic (PW) and hydrophilic (MXene) components causes an uneven change in d-spacing, making the film bend under intense sunlight and stretch under normal light conditions, enabling inchworm-inspired crawling motion 86. Similarly, a study by Luo et al. demonstrated a bilayer actuator by spraying MXenes onto a plasma-treated LDPE film87. These modification approaches have opened a new generation of MXene-based actuators for soft robotics and wearable devices with adaptive structures.\n",
      "Chemical sensors\n",
      "Chemical sensors, including chemiresistive, chemicapacitive, and electrochemical sensors, convert signals arising from chemical interactions between the sensor material and an analyte into analytical signals that are correlated with the amount of analyte interacting with the material surface. Generally, these sensors experience a change in impedance when an analyte binds to the surface, expressed as higher or lower resistance, voltage, or current. The majority are used as biosensors for analytes like biomolecules88,89 and biomarkers90,91,92, as MXene under certain conditions has also shown exceptional biocompatibility93,94. Additionally, MXenes possess a unique combination of metallic-like conductivity and highly reactive surface terminations, which enhances bremains uncertain due to a lack of extended experimental dataoth charge transport and interactions with target analytes. The diverse interactions of MXenes with chemical species have enabled the development of various sensors. This section summarizes and highlights three key types of MXene-based chemical sensors and their associated challenges.\n",
      "Chemiresistive sensors\n",
      "Chemiresistive sensors measure variations in electrical resistance brought about by analyte adsorption on the sensor surface, altering charge carrier density95,96. Due to the simple and indiscriminate nature of the mechanism, chemiresistive sensors are ideal for applications requiring high adsorption and response rates, like gas sensing. Materials with reactive or porous surfaces capable of high signal-to-noise (S/N) output, including metal oxides97,98, carbon nanomaterials99,100,101, and conducting polymers102, have found success in the field but suffer from high operating temperatures, low processability, and declined performance when bent or twisted103,104. MXene overcomes these issues through its mechanical properties, processability, and thermal stability. Early reports of MXene-based chemiresistors focused on the detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like acetone, ethanol, ammonia, and propanal using Ti3C2Tx95,96, which exhibited an S/N ratio more than two orders of magnitude higher than other 2D materials105 (-i). DFT simulations highlighted that the hydroxyl (-OH) surface group largely improves affinity to analytes through strong hydrogen-bonding interactions106. The specific mechanism for chemiresistive sensing in Ti3C2Tx is similar to that of p-type materials, where the adsorption of reducing gas molecules in defect sites and surface functional groups leads to an increase in resistance106,107 (-ii). Theoretical simulations suggested that introducing additional vacancies in Ti coordination could further enhance sensing performance by increasing the physical adsorption of analytes108. The findings from these pioneering studies, including the sensing mechanism of Ti3C2Tx, opened opportunities in developing similar technologies based on other MXene variants, such as V4C3Tx and V2CTx102,109. Interestingly, the vanadium (V)-based MXenes were found to respond to nonpolar gases as well. V2CTx-based gas sensors can detect hydrogen and methane with LODs of 2 and 25 ppm, respectively, at room temperature, ascribed to the high affinity of gases to the transition metal V102. Aside from typical VOCs, chemiresistive MXene-based sensors are also popular in humidity sensing due to MXene's hydrophilicity110,111,112,113.\n",
      "Achieving higher sensitivity with pristine MXene-based chemiresistive sensors encounters issues such as sheet restacking. For example, fabrication techniques like drop-casting or vacuum filtration can create dense MXene membranes and block active sites. This can be addressed by using porous architectures or modified 3D templates to enhance mass transport. Ti3C2Tx-coated porous nonwoven fabric gas sensor enhanced analyte diffusion and interaction with MXene, achieving a response 3.5 times greater than the as-prepared MXene at a fast rate (1.5 min) with low LOD (50 ppb)114.\n",
      "MXene can be hybridized with inorganic nanomaterials115,116 or organic fillers117 to increase active sites and/or reduce or modulate its electrical conductivity, enabling the measurement of smaller resistance changes. For instance, Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 heterostructure gas sensors exhibited higher sensitivity and faster recovery time than Ti3C2Tx after exposure to ethanol (1-40 ppm). Aside from the stark difference in performance, the two samples exhibited contrasting sensing mechanisms, with Ti3C2Tx as p-type and Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 as n-type sensors115. Control over band structures was used to improve selectivity between two gases, resolving the issue of indiscriminate sensing in chemiresistive sensors, using a Ti3C2Tx/WSe2 heterostructure107, whereby reducing and oxidizing gases produced opposite transient response curves (-iii). Hybrid materials can also enable the detection of species such as biomolecules. MXene-chitosan sensors fabricated via dip coating with chitosan are used as enzymatic biosensors. Chitosan and Ti3C2Tx served as a support matrix to immobilize cholesterol oxidase enzymes and enhance electrical conductivity117.\n",
      "Capacitive sensors\n",
      "MXene's hydrophilicity makes it ideal for capacitive humidity sensing, measuring capacitance changes due to changes in electrode distance or area. Although its potential for humidity sensing was implied in early reports111,118, pristine MXene suffers from poor selectivity and sensitivity119. This issue is remedied by employing semiconductors to design heterostructures and form Schottky barriers. The Ti3C2/TiO2-based humidity sensor was prepared by growing TiO2 nanowires on exposed Ti sites across the Ti3C2Tx structure, increasing the surface area and adsorption sites to enhance the sensor performance. Water adsorption increased carrier concentration and lowered the hole energy level barrier at the Ti3C2/TiO2 Schottky junction, increasing conductance and achieving high sensitivity (280 pF/RH%) even at low humidity120 (-i). Similarly, high surface area tin sulfide (SnS2) was decorated with Ti3C2Tx sheets to achieve a capacitance increase (sensitivity metric) of 433,827% from 7% to 93% RH at 1 kHz excitation frequency, compared to the 59,306% increase using just SnS2121. Apart from MXene-semiconductor heterostructures, using MXene with metal nanoparticles like silver (AgNPs) also improves charge mobility and sensitivity. Ti3C2Tx accommodates two layers of H2O molecules through H-bonding before succeeding layers are merely physisorbed and become mobile, with some molecules undergoing ionization and therefore acting as charge carriers. The presence of AgNPs decreases the energy barrier for the interaction of water molecules with the sensing layer. The synergy between Ti3C2Tx and AgNPs resulted in a 15-fold improvement in sensitivity in the composite sensor (106,800%) vs. Ti3C2Tx122. Furthermore, the interaction between the Ti3C2/Ag system can be improved through plasma treatment123.\n",
      "MXene's susceptibility to oxidation in aqueous and humid environments affects the integrity and reproducibility, requiring the addition of hydrophobic or antioxidative materials and other post-treatments. For example, a sodium ascorbate (SA)/MXene ink remained stable for printing flexible humidity sensors when stored for 30 days124 (-ii). The cross-linked Ti3C2Tx film with polyethyleneimine and glutaraldehyde also exhibited improved stability after long-term storage125.\n",
      "Electrochemical sensors\n",
      "Electrochemical sensors rely on redox-mediated charge transfer processes occurring between the material and the analyte to produce a current or potential that is proportional to the amount of analyte interacting with the recognition element 126. Depending on the technique (potentiometric, amperometric, or impedimetric), sensor design, and electrochemical activity of the analyte, the sensor responds to the analyte either directly or indirectly127. These variables play into the adaptability of electrochemical sensing, from material design to technique optimization, and open it up to a wide range of analytes from metal ions to pathogens128,129,130,131 while employing metal-organic frameworks132,133, enzymes134,135,136,137, aptamers138,139, and molecularly imprinted polymers140,141,142 as recognition elements. MXene's tunable composition, surface reactivity, high conductivity, and large surface area collectively benefit electrochemical sensors143,144. For example, the layered structure and surface chemistry of Ti3C2Tx are ideal for ion-selective electrodes (ISE) , and modification with certain chemical moieties improves selectivity126,145,146. Pristine MXene (Ti3C2Tx) was also found to improve peak separation and sensitivity in multicomponent sensing88. Aside from its chemical and electrical properties, architecture and morphology also play a crucial role in the performance of MXene-based electrochemical sensors by optimizing ion mobility within the structure. Controlling the porosity and sheet alignment facilitates the migration of analytes19,147 and even sensing elements like enzymes148 into the MXene structure.\n",
      "The applicability of MXene-based electrochemical sensors is challenged primarily by oxidation in water, which limits their anodic potential windows in aqueous solutions149,150. Growing a poly(amidoamine) dendrimer improves the anodic stability of Ti3C2Tx151 , but the mechanism by which this occurs remains underexplored. Another relevant issue is the optimization of faradaic interactions between MXene and the analyte, especially at bulk configurations. Noriega et al. reported that thin MXene films composed of large sheets provide better S/N ratio, as opposed to thick films or films made from small sheets152.\n",
      "Sheet restacking in electrochemical sensors also limits mass transport. Incorporating spacers with high analyte affinity increases interlayer spacing, creating more active sites for small organic molecules153,154. Incorporating MXenes into porous and 3D architectures can also help to further address this issue155. Kalasin et al. reported improved sensing efficiency by adding solid-contact sodium (Na+)-intercalated (sodiated) nanoporous carbon/polyethylene glycol and Ti3C2Tx layers to sodiated transducers composed of PEDOT:PSS for potentiometric Na+ sensing and polypyrrole for voltametric creatinine detection155 .\n",
      "Optical and spectroscopic sensors\n",
      "MXene-based optical sensors utilize plasmonic properties and tunable electronic structures to detect stimuli such as light, chemicals, and biomolecules, enabling efficient signal transduction through high conductivity and surface functional groups. MXenes enhance the sensitivity of optical sensors by facilitating strong light-matter interactions and supporting localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)156. Each type of sensor, along with its associated challenges, is discussed in this section with a comprehensive summary in .\n",
      "Plasmonic sensors\n",
      "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) occurs when free electrons on a metal surface resonate with incident light. SPR sensors detect molecular interactions by measuring refractive index changes near a metal-dielectric interface. MXene offers significant advantages in SPR sensors due to its large lateral size, which enhances contact with metal layers and facilitates interaction with the sensing medium and electromagnetic fields. Its strong light absorption157 and low transmission loss158 improve sensor sensitivity and electric field enhancement near the sensing medium. MXene's optical transparency, stability, and tunable bandgap also enable high penetration depth and sensitivity159. Moreover, MXene's high surface area-to-volume ratio enhances the binding capacity of the metal layer for analytes, overcoming the limitations of traditional metal films. Its tunable surface chemistry further underscores its suitability for SPR-based biosensors160. It also protects the metal layer from oxidation by acting as a dielectric layer, further boosting sensitivity.\n",
      "MXene-based SPR sensors are typically fabricated so that incident light interacts with the sensor chip through a prism positioned beneath the sensor substrate. The two most commonly used prism configurations are the Kretschmann and the Otto configurations161. In the Kretschmann configuration, light passes through the prism and reflects off a thin metal layer coated on its surface, exciting surface plasmons at a specific resonance angle. In contrast, the Otto configuration features a small air gap between the prism and the metal layer, where surface plasmons are excited by an evanescent wave.\n",
      "To overcome challenges such as limited penetration depth and sensitivity, advanced designs like a nearly guided wave SPR configuration have been introduced. The Otto setup offers greater durability under high-intensity light due to its superior thermal resistance and reduced wear on the metal layer. However, it is more complex to implement, as it requires precise control of the air gap.\n",
      "The Kretschmann configuration, on the other hand, is simpler to set up and is therefore preferred for standard applications involving moderate light intensity162. MXene's exceptional mechanical and thermal stability163 makes it particularly well-suited for use in the Kretschmann configuration, further enhancing the performance and practicality of MXene-based SPR sensors.\n",
      "Multi-pronged factors, such as penetration depth, are crucial for SPR sensors, as they define how far the plasmonic (electric) field extends from the metal surface into the sensing region, determining the interaction range with the target material. In propagating SPR, however, the penetration depth is relatively limited164. To address this, researchers have explored various advanced SPR configurations, such as incorporating a thin high-index dielectric film between the metal and sensing layer, known as nearly guided wave SPR, which enhances sensitivity165.\n",
      "For example, Wu et al. demonstrated an SPR biosensor enhanced with a few-layer Ti3C2Tx MXene, which improves sensitivity and acts as a protective layer on metal thin films. Sensitivity enhancements of up to 46.3% and a maximum of 224.5°/RIU demonstrate the potential use of MXene in advancing SPR biosensing technology166. Similarly, a functionalized MXene-based SPR sensor for early SARS-CoV-2 detection by immobilizing thiol-tethered ssDNA on the MXene layer, demonstrating high sensitivity and selectivity167.\n",
      "The performance of the proposed SPR biosensor strongly depends on the number of Ti3C2Tx MXene layers. Increasing the layer count broadens the Au-based SPR curves due to electron energy loss and shifts the resonance angle through enhanced light absorption. Sensitivity improves significantly up to four MXene layers but tends to plateau beyond that, even when combined with other materials. For example, SPR sensors paired with gold, aluminum, and copper show limited sensitivity gains at λ = 633 nm, with enhancements of 28.4%, 46.3%, and 33.6% enhancements for 7, 12, and 9 MXene layers, respectively166.\n",
      "A theoretical study using finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations examined MXene layer thickness ranging from 1 to 10 layers and found that thickness significantly affects sensor sensitivity. Notably, the effect varies with surface termination. F-terminated MXene achieved the highest sensitivity at 133.39°/RIU168.\n",
      "Although direct experimental research on surface terminations in SPR sensors is still lacking, surface terminations are known to influence MXene's electronic structure. For example, outermost halogen terminations like -I, and -Br can gain electrons and convert to their elemental forms when used as cathodes in Ti3C2I2 or Ti3C2Br2169. This electronic transformation impacts the plasmonic properties of MXene170,171. Future experimental studies are expected to further explore how surface terminations affect SPR sensor performance, offering deeper insights into optimizing these materials.\n",
      "Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (SERS) sensors, another type of plasmonic sensor, amplify weak Raman scattering signals through surface-enhanced scattering. Since the first report of pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene as a SERS substrate in 2017172, numerous studies have explored its properties and applications. Researchers have examined the effects of MXene terminal groups173, layer thickness174, and crystallinity175 on SERS performance.\n",
      "For instance, Ti3C2O2-terminated MXene demonstrates superior SERS activity compared to Ti3C2(OH)2 due to its ability to generate a stronger near-field effect. The layer thickness of Ti3C2Tx nanosheets also plays a crucial role, as Raman enhancement is highly thickness dependent. Studies have demonstrated that films thinner than 0.8 μm (for 532 nm) and 1.0 μm (for 633 nm) laser excitations provide strong enhancement for methylene blue detection. However, once the thickness exceeds 2.0 μm, the enhancement levels off, indicating a threshold beyond which additional layers no longer contribute significantly to the collective effect. Additionally, crystallinity is key to SERS performance. For instance, a highly crystalline monolayer Ti3C2Tx capable of maintaining its structure forms a nucleus-free 2D electron gas, enabling strong visible-range localized SPR (LSPR, defined as the SPR phenomenon exhibited in nano-regime) that enhances SERS sensitivity. Beyond studies of pristine MXene substrates, integrating MXenes with noble metals has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing SERS performance176,177. This approach leverages the plasmonic properties of noble metals alongside the unique electronic properties of MXenes, resulting in highly sensitive and versatile SERS platforms.\n",
      "A prominent resonance around ~1.7 eV has become a key in understanding the signal enhancement mechanism, though its exact origin remains under investigation172178. In the case of Ti3C2Tx, the near-infrared absorption peak at ~1.7 eV (800 nm) has been attributed to a combination of interband transitions (IBT) and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Density functional theory (DFT) studies support the IBT hypothesis, highlighting the peak's sensitivity to surface terminations while showing it to be largely independent of particle size179 and solvent environment180.\n",
      "Evidence for LSPR contributions includes the detection of transverse plasmonic resonances via STEM-EELS178 and voltage-induced blueshifts in electrochromic devices181. Ongoing and future studies are expected to clarify the underlying mechanisms and facilitate the continued development of MXene-based SERS substrates.\n",
      "Electrochemiluminescent and photoluminescent sensors\n",
      "In addition to plasmonic sensors, MXenes have also been investigated for their potential in luminescent sensing182. Luminescent sensors generate and separate charge carriers to produce an electrical signal upon light exposure. Due to high light absorption, efficient charge transport, and catalytic activity, MXenes have been employed as photoactive materials in these types of sensors to detect various analytes, such as heavy metals, organic pollutants, and biomolecules. In addition, MXenes have shown great promise as luminescent materials for biosensing, as their photoluminescence can be modulated through surface functionalization and interactions with target analytes. For instance, Ti3C2 MXene quantum dots detect metal ions and small molecules based on their photoluminescence quenching or enhancement effects183.\n",
      "However, MXenes also face challenges in photoluminescent sensing, such as weak photoluminescence efficiency, which limits sensitivity, and instability due to surface defects, oxidation, and degradation in aqueous environments. This issue can be addressed by doping MXene Quantum dots (MQDs) with metal or non-metal elements, like nitrogen, sulfur, or transition metals (e.g., Mn and Cu), to alter their electronic properties and introduce new energy levels, thereby improving photoluminescent efficiency. For instance, a Cu ion sensor was developed using nitrogen-doped MQDs (N-MQDs), where PL quenching depended on Cu ion concentration184. Another sensor, made with nitrogen and phosphorus-doped MQDs, showed enhanced quenching and a low LOD for Cu ions. MQDs can also be detected in ions such as Fe and Cd185.\n",
      "Ti3C2Tx is highly promising for fluorescence detection due to its excellent performance in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), serving as an effective energy acceptor and fluorescence quencher, making it ideal for MXene-based fluorescent aptasensors186. For instance, a Ti3C2Tx MXene-based FRET aptasensor was demonstrated for thrombin detection using fluorescein amidite-labeled aptamers. The aptamers bind to Ti3C2Tx, enabling fluorescence quenching via FRET, demonstrating high sensitivity, specificity, and potential for clinical and bioactive molecule detection187. Other MXenes, such as FL-V2CTx and ML-V2CTx, have been explored for fluorescence sensors188. Few-layered MXenes offer improved adsorption and desorption capabilities due to their larger surface area, while multi-layered MXenes may face limitations, such as weaker fluorescence. However, the differences in performance between few- and multi-layered MXenes highlight the need for further investigation to optimize their use in fluorescence-based sensing applications. Although MXene-based aptasensors are promising, they remain in the early stages. Challenges such as short aptamer half-lives and a lack of diverse aptamers highlight the need for developing innovative strategies in future research186.\n",
      "Unlocking potential: exploring opportunities in unresolved challenges\n",
      "The literature highlights efforts to address challenges in MXene-based sensors, yet unresolved barriers persist, which are discussed in this section .\n",
      "A standardized method of producing MXenes\n",
      "Reviews on MXenes consistently emphasize that differences in synthesis methods and precursors result in variations in MXene properties189,190,191. MXenes etched with 50% HF or LiF/HCl exhibited different surface compositions, impacting their dispersibility192. Post-synthetic processes, including drying, can cause MXene to restack, altering its behavior. A solvent exchange technique could bypass drying for MXenes, enabling solution processing of MXene-based fiber composites193. These studies highlight how surface composition variations from different etching methods influence MXene performance in various solvent environments. Therefore, further research is needed to achieve uniform surface terminations and device architectures for specific sensing applications. Currently, surface modifications like covalent or noncovalent interactions with large molecules194,195, surfactants196, or polymers35 are performed. These modifications are customized for specific techniques that require tailored surface properties and solvent interactions.\n",
      "Cost-effective, scalable and sustainable production of MXenes\n",
      "To make MXene-based sensors commercially viable, production must become more cost-effective and scalable without compromising performance. However, producing high-quality MXenes with consistent structural, chemical, and electrical properties at scale remains technically challenging and resource-intensive. Conventional methods, such as selective etching using hydrofluoric acid or in-situ HF generation, rely on hazardous chemicals, require precise reaction control, and generate significant chemical waste. These issues raise safety, environmental, and cost concerns.\n",
      "To overcome these limitations, research is shifting toward more sustainable and economical strategies. One promising approach involves repurposing carbon-rich industrial byproducts or biomass to produce MAX phase precursors197. This approach not only reduces raw material costs but also aligns with circular economy goals by turning waste into valuable feedstock. At the same time, synthesis techniques are being optimized for large-scale production. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), particularly with titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4), a low-cost manufacturing precursor, offers a scalable, cleaner alternative to etching. CVD enables the direct synthesis of Cl-terminated MXenes, which show greater structural stability and oxidation resistance than conventional -OH, -O, or -F terminated MXenes from wet-etching methods198.\n",
      "Vapor-phase growth methods like CVD offer enhanced control over film thickness, crystallinity, and uniformity, which are parameters critical for device integration and reproducibility. CVD allows for precise engineering of surface terminations, opening new opportunities for tailoring MXene properties for specific sensing applications.\n",
      "Life cycle assessments (LCAs) further support the need for synthesis optimization. Recent studies highlight that electricity consumption during production is a major contributor to environmental impact199. By simplifying synthesis, eliminating hazardous chemicals, and integrating process cost analysis, the overall sustainability and scalability of MXene production can be significantly improved.\n",
      "As demand grows for flexible and wearable electronics, adopting scalable and environmentally sustainable methods like CVD becomes increasingly important. When combined with the use of industrial waste streams and streamlined synthesis protocols, these strategies represent a key step toward realizing the large-scale, reliable manufacturing of MXene-based sensors and devices.\n",
      "Addressing MXene stability issues\n",
      "MXenes are known to undergo surface degradation when exposed to water, resulting in the formation of oxide layers that compromise their electrical conductivity and overall performance200. Additionally, prolonged exposure to such conditions can lead to the loss of essential surface terminations, which are critical for their functionality. In practical device applications, MXene-based sensors are particularly vulnerable to harsh environmental conditions such as human sweat, body heat, and friction-induced mechanical stress201. Sweat, which contains water, salts, and various biomolecules, creates an electrolyte-rich environment that promotes the electrochemical oxidation of MXenes. Elevated temperatures from body heat further accelerate this degradation process. As oxidation progresses, surface oxides form, reducing the electrical conductivity and sensing capabilities of the material.\n",
      "Mechanical stress from continuous movement, bending, and skin contact introduces shear forces that can lead to microcracks, delamination, or abrasion of protective coatings. These mechanical damages expose fresh MXene surfaces to ambient oxygen and moisture, which are highly reactive and prone to rapid oxidation. This results in a recurring degradation cycle. The combined effects of chemical exposure from sweat and mechanical wear are well-established contributors to the accelerated deterioration of MXene-based sensors149, ultimately leading to reduced signal stability, increased noise, and diminished sensitivity and durability, thus limiting the long-term usability of wearable devices.\n",
      "To enhance MXene stability, surface passivation and protective coatings such as polymers, self-assembled monolayers, or inorganic layers are commonly employed. While these approaches have shown short-term effectiveness, their long-term performance under real-world conditions remains uncertain due to a lack of extended experimental data202,203,204. Over time, passivation layers can degrade through mechanical abrasion, delamination, or the infiltration of oxygen and water molecules via microscopic defects or diffusion pathways. Once compromised, these layers expose the underlying MXene, restarting the degradation process.\n",
      "Therefore, ensuring long-term reliability of MXene-based sensors requires further research into robust encapsulation strategies and implementation of realistic aging protocols. These efforts are essential to fully understand and address the time-dependent failure mechanisms of passivated MXene-based sensors in practical environments.\n",
      "Large-scale integration and real-world testing\n",
      "Integrating MXenes into devices while retaining their unique properties remains challenging. Key obstacles include achieving uniformity, ensuring compatibility with diverse substrates, and enabling scalable, efficient fabrication205. Despite notable progress, most studies remain confined to controlled laboratory environments that do not reflect real-world conditions.\n",
      "To move MXene-based sensors toward commercial use, rigorous testing under diverse environmental conditions is essential. Scalability will depend on standardized protocols for material selection, device fabrication, and performance metrics like sensitivity, response time, and detection limits. Long-term reliability, mechanical durability, calibration consistency, and quality control are also critical to ensure manufacturability and real-world functionality.\n",
      "Start-ups will play a key role in bridging the gap between research and commercialization. Their agility allows them to focus on targeted applications, refine production methods, and respond quickly to market demands. By fostering innovation across cross-sector collaboration, start-ups can accelerate product development and reduce the risks associated with early-stage technology.\n",
      "This is particularly valuable in fast-moving fields of wearable electronics and smart systems, where user needs and supply chains are still evolving. With growing investment and interdisciplinary cooperation, start-ups are poised to drive the adoption of MXene-based sensors in next-generation intelligent and flexible technologies.\n",
      "Potential use of artificial intelligence in design and testing\n",
      "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) offers great potential for enhancing MXene-based sensors, driving improvements in design, optimization, and overall performance. AI can serve as a tool for refining key aspects of fabrication, such as material density, surface uniformity, and electrode placement, ensuring consistency and preserving signal integrity. Through AI-driven design and modeling, complex interactions between sensor components can be analyzed, leading to more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective sensor development. Furthermore, AI's ability to process large datasets allows for the identification of hidden patterns, relationships, and anomalies during fabrication and testing. This optimization can enable continuous, real-time data analysis, supporting personalized and highly responsive monitoring. Integrating AI with MXene sensor research could expand their capabilities, offering dynamic, accessible, and impactful solutions for environmental monitoring, healthcare, and many other applications.\n",
      "However, it is important to emphasize that the success of AI models heavily depends on the quality and reliability of the underlying sensor data. If sensor systems are not stable or consistent over time, they can produce noisy, incomplete, or inaccurate datasets. Such compromised data will negatively impact the training process of AI algorithms, leading to models that perform poorly when applied to real-world conditions. This limitation can reduce the predictive accuracy, generalizability, and robustness of AI-driven solutions, ultimately hindering their practical utility. Therefore, ensuring the development of reliable, durable, and high-quality MXene sensors is a critical prerequisite for effective AI integration. Without this foundation, the benefits of AI in improving sensor performance, scalability, and application-specific customization will be significantly diminished, underscoring the need for continued research focused on sensor stability and reproducibility.\n",
      "Summary and conclusion\n",
      "Substantial progress has been made in advancing MXene-based sensors, setting the stage for their potential commercialization. Nonetheless, industrial-scale production and application still face significant obstacles. Although Ti3C2Tx MXenes are highly responsive active materials for physical sensors (e.g., strain and pressure), they are primarily limited by mechanical stability. Fortunately, their compatibility with polymers and their ability to form films, fibers, or aerogels allows for versatile sensor designs. Integrating MXenes into 3D structures enhances mechanical properties, increases surface area, and improves sensitivity to dynamic loading and deformation. Improved coating techniques for enhanced substrate compatibility help mitigate issues like delamination and damage during repeated physical processes, further enhancing durability and functionality. On the other hand, MXenes face challenges in force-sensitive sensing applications like acoustic, temperature, and photoresponsive detection due to excessive conductivity. Hybrid nanomaterial structures are addressing these issues by enhancing performance and adding functionalities beyond the intrinsic capabilities of MXenes. Meanwhile, chemical and electrochemical sensors based on MXenes often struggle with limited mass transport to active sites due to their tendency to layer and restack. Additionally, MXenes' susceptibility to oxidation compromises performance in chemical environments. Active materials and interlayer spacers are integrated into MXenes to improve mass transport, prevent oxidation, and reduce issues with conductivity and capacitive behavior, thus enhancing analyte signal detection. Optical and spectroscopic sensors relying on MXenes' electromagnetic properties require highly uniform chemical structures and surfaces. Strategies such as surface modifications and composite materials can be employed to address this. However, the interfacial interactions between MXenes and functional materials, as well as the fundamental issues in MXene-based optical sensors, require further investigation and remain a complex area of ongoing research. Moreover, the commercialization of MXene-based sensors is hindered by costly, hazardous synthesis, stability issues like oxidation, and scalability challenges. The lack of real-world testing in existing studies also poses a challenge. Overall, tackling these issues is expected to accelerate the development of next-generation MXene-based sensors.\n",
