This project involves extracting and analyzing scientific texts from a list of journal article DOIs. The goal is to build a clean, structured dataset of research abstracts or 
full texts that can later be used to train a domain-specific large language model (LLM). The goal is to write scripts to fetch content using DOIs, preprocess the text, and 
perform exploratory quantitative analysis such as keyword frequency, topic modeling, and publication trend analysis. This dataset will then be handed over for LLM training. 
The project provides valuable hands-on experience with data pipelines, API integration, and NLP preprocessing.
